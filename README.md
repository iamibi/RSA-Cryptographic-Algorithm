How to run the cipher?

If you don't have python installed, go to *https://www.python.org/downloads/* and download Python 3.x (x for the latest Python 3 version)for your Operating System.

>1. First we have to generate the key pairs...
>>    Run the GenerateKey.py as 
>>>        python3.x GenerateKey.py
>>    (Where x is the python 3 version in your system, by default its generally 3.4)

>2. Then to encrypt or decrypt the message...
>>    Run the RSA-Cipher.py as
>>>        python3.x RSA-Cipher.py
