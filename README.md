How to run the cipher?

1. First we have to generate the key pairs...
    Run the GenerateKey.py as 
        python3.x GenerateKey.py
    (Where x is the python 3 version in your system, by default its generally 3.4)

2. Then to encrypt or decrypt the message...
    Run the RSA-Cipher.py as
        python3.x RSA-Cipher.py
